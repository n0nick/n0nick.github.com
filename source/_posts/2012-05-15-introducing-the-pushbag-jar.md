We use [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/) for version control in
Waze, mainly for legacy reasons. We don't like it that much (compared to
Git), but it's working.

However, as our web team is growing, we find ourselves struggling over
and over again to understand why something that worked a few minutes ago
(before the [merge](http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Merge)) doesn't
anymore.

The thing is, it's usually somebody's fault. And that person should be
educated.
Instead of straightforward educating, we decided to go with humiliating.
Much more fun this way.

Thus came **[The Pushbag Jar](http://n0nick.github.com/pushbag/)**,
modeled after [New Girl's Douchebag
Jar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIrFhZe_dD4). We wrote down a few
basic, civil rules, that if you break them - you have to pay, and also
move the jar to your desk, so everyone beholds your pushbaggery.

You can see our rules list [on this page](http://n0nick.github.com/pushbag/).  
We haven't decided on what to do with the collected taxes yet, but I'll
let you know if it's something funny.Â
