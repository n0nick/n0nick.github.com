<p>I wanted to work on adding a nice 'loading...' effect to my application, of which I have little access to its server code. I needed to find a way to slow down my AJAX calls, so I can see the effect and tweak it in my browser.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, AJAX is too fast on a local environment, and I couldn't find anything about slowing jQuery down (all Google found were 'jQuery script too slow' question pages).</p>
<p>Fortunately, a co-worker and I figured that we could take advantage of the new <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/" target="_blank">jQuery Deferred objects</a>.<br />I added this line to a function that wraps AJAX calls:</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/1194488</p>
<p>And it worked like magic.</p>
<p>It merges the original AJAX's promise along with something that takes time (i.e. the 3s <code>fadeOut</code> animation), and then uses a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/" target="_blank">deferred pipe</a> to make the promise only return the original AJAX result.</p>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>You use it like this:</p>
