<p><strong>Log in sucks.</strong><br /> I hate logging in to stuff.<br />On my own devices, I always tick 'Remember me'. I never log out. Why should I?</p>
<p>The reasons for logging in are all understandable.<br /> It's a solution for many problems.<br />But it's a bad solution. <em>Passwords</em> are for safes in banks and <em>usernames</em> are just nothings.</p>
<p>When I try to do something and the machine stops me and shouts at me <em>Error! You are not logged in! Your authentication failed! You do not have permissions for this task!</em>, I feel stupid.<br /> And machines are not supposed to make me feel stupid.</p>
<p>And what more, <strong>logging in absolutely breaks the user experience</strong>.<br /> I get to a blog, I read a post, I read the comments, I like the post, I want to let the author know, I click "like".<br /> I get an ERROR MESSAGE. <em>You need to be logged in to do that</em>. Argh.<br />I log in, or sign up, or 'forget my password' (blerg) and then it takes me to the site's homepage.<br /> I... wait, homepage? I didn't ask to be on the damn homepage.<br /> I'll try to find that post I was reading. I'll try the "Back" button but it'd fail because of the POST call. I'll give up. I'll leave.<br /> Are you happy, website?</p>
<p>Logging in and maintaining an <em>account</em>&nbsp;is an experience bug that should be fixed.<br />But in the meantime, would websites redirect me back to what I was doing?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://blog.stefandeboey.be/copy-bookmarks-from-read-it-later-to-instapap" target="_blank">this post</a> by a guy named Stefan a few minutes ago.<br /> I clicked 'like' and Posterous asked me to log in. I did, it took me more than a minute because I forgot the password for my old account, and then I got to a page with this message:</p>

<p>A perfectly normal turn of events!<br />But 'normal' is such an outstanding word in the web user experience world.</p>
<p>So, kudos to Posterous.<br />A good time to try my years-old "tech blog" idea.</p>
