<p>We use <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/" target="_blank">Bazaar</a> for version control in Waze, mainly for legacy reasons. We don't like it that much (compared to Git), but it's working.</p><p>However, as our web team is growing, we find ourselves struggling over and over again to understand why something that worked a few minutes ago (before the <a href="http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Merge" target="_blank">merge</a>) doesn't anymore.</p><p>The thing is, it's usually somebody's fault. And that person should be educated.<br />Instead of straightforward educating, we decided to go with humiliating. Much more fun this way.</p><p>Thus came <strong><a href="http://n0nick.github.com/pushbag/" target="_blank">The Pushbag Jar</a></strong>, modeled after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIrFhZe_dD4" target="_blank">New Girl's Douchebag Jar</a>. We wrote down a few basic, civil rules, that if you break them - you have to pay, and also move the jar to your desk, so everyone beholds your pushbaggery.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oIrFhZe_dD4?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p><p>You can see our rules list <a href="http://n0nick.github.com/pushbag/" target="_blank">on this page</a>.<br />We haven't decided on what to do with the collected taxes yet, but I'll let you know if it's something funny.&nbsp;</p>
