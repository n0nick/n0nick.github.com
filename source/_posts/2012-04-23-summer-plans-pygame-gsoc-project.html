<p>Well, after about an hour of repeatedly refreshing the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012">Accepted Projects page</a> in Google's GSoC website, I ended up getting the news by email: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/n0nick/28002">my project proposal for Pygame</a> was accepted, and I'll be working on my project starting in May 21st.</p><p><a href="http://dotfile.n0nick.net/google-summer-of-code-2012-applying-for-pygam">As I already said</a>, I'm really excited about this project and about the opportunity!<br />Unfortunately, I have to wait with the plans until later, as I have a mid-term tomorrow morning.</p><p>Here we go again!</p>
