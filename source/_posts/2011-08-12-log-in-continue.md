**Log in sucks.**

I hate logging in to stuff.

On my own devices, I always tick 'Remember me'. I never log out. Why
should I?

The reasons for logging in are all understandable.  
 It's a solution for many problems.  
But it's a bad solution. *Passwords* are for safes in banks and
*usernames* are just nothings.

When I try to do something and the machine stops me and shouts at me
*Error! You are not logged in! Your authentication failed! You do not
have permissions for this task!*, I feel stupid.  
 And machines are not supposed to make me feel stupid.

And what more, **logging in absolutely breaks the user experience**.  
 I get to a blog, I read a post, I read the comments, I like the post, I
want to let the author know, I click "like".  
 I get an ERROR MESSAGE. *You need to be logged in to do that*. Argh.  
I log in, or sign up, or 'forget my password' (blerg) and then it takes
me to the site's homepage.  
 I... wait, homepage? I didn't ask to be on the damn homepage.  
 I'll try to find that post I was reading. I'll try the "Back" button
but it'd fail because of the POST call. I'll give up. I'll leave.  
 Are you happy, website?

Logging in and maintaining an *account* is an experience bug that should
be fixed.  
But in the meantime, would websites redirect me back to what I was
doing?

Thanks.

I was reading [this
post](http://blog.stefandeboey.be/copy-bookmarks-from-read-it-later-to-instapap)
by a guy named Stefan a few minutes ago.  
 I clicked 'like' and Posterous asked me to log in. I did, it took me
more than a minute because I forgot the password for my old account, and
then I got to a page with this message:

A perfectly normal turn of events!  
But 'normal' is such an outstanding word in the web user experience
world.

So, kudos to Posterous.  
A good time to try my years-old "tech blog" idea.
