Well, after about an hour of repeatedly refreshing the [Accepted Projects page]
in Google's GSoC website, I ended up getting the news by email:
[my project proposal for Pygame] was accepted, and I'll be working on my project
starting in May 21st.

[As I already said], I'm really excited about this project and about the opportunity!  
Unfortunately, I have to wait with the plans until later, as I have a mid-term
tomorrow morning.

Here we go again!
