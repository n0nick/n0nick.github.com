<p>This is hilarious:</p>
<p>A co-worker noticed something strange happening in his Chrome browser: Every element in an HTML page that has an <code>id</code> attribute gets attached as a member of the global <code>window</code> object!<br />I checked and it happens in my Safari as well. A bit of googling led us to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3434278/ie-chrome-are-dom-tree-elements-global-variables-here" target="_blank">the answer at StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What is supposed to happen is that &lsquo;named elements&rsquo; are added as apparent properties of the <code>document</code> object. This is a really bad idea, as it allows element names to clash with real properties of <code>document</code>.</p>
  <p>IE made the situation worse by also adding named elements as properties of the <code>window</code> object. This is doubly bad in that now you have to avoid naming your elements after any member of either the <code>document</code> or the <code>window</code> object you (or any other library code in your project) might want to use.</p>

<p>...</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
  <p>Opera copied IE, then WebKit joined in, and now both the previously-unstandardised practice of putting named elements on <code>document</code> properties, and the previously-IE-only practice of putting them on <code>window</code> are <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#dom-document-nameditem">being</a> <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#named-access-on-the-window-object">standardised</a> by HTML5, whose approach is to document and standardise every terrible practice inflicted on us by browser authors, making them part of the web forever. So Firefox 4 will also support this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such a funny turn of events. And a great metaphor for how these inner decisions are made in browser politics.</p>
