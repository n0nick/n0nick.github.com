	<div class="entry-content"><p>While I&#8217;m fully aware that I haven&#8217;t posted here for more than six months, I&#8217;m going to completely ignore this and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2009/mar/17/keep-calm-carry-on-pictures?picture=344713815" target="_blank">carry on</a>. Hope that would work.</p><p style="text-align: center;">*</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code</a> is a brilliant thing. For those of you who don&#8217;t know it, every summer Google uses its influence and many dollars to connect Computer Science students with open source projects, paying students for a 3 months long contribution to an accepted open source project.<br />Students win, because they gain experience while studying (and also, dollars).<br />Open source projects win, because they can get a lot done during the summer, and &#8216;recruit&#8217; new contributors.<br />Open source wins, because more young students are familiar with it and the way it works.<br />Google wins, because it can&#8217;t ever lose.</p><p>During the 2011 summer I&#8217;ve participated in GSoC, <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/n0nick/1" target="_blank">developing a Maltese-Hebrew machine translation module</a> for the <a href="http://www.apertium.org/">Apertium</a> open source translation toolkit.<br />It was a lot of fun and a whole lot of work. I learned an absurd amount of stuff about computational linguistics, text manipulation, Python work and open source projects internals. I&#8217;ve worked with some really cool people. And I actually built a machine translation module.</p><p>But it was also somewhat overwhelming, merely from a logistic point of view.<br />You see, even though most GSoC students are internationals, Google&#8217;s timeline is set according to that of American schools. So instead of using my summer vacation for the project, I had to start work during my finals period. This wasn&#8217;t fun. And for most of the development time, I had to juggle between school, GSoC work, and my dayjob at Waze. This wasn&#8217;t fun at all.</p><p>Why, then, would I apply again?<br />My best guess is I&#8217;m too much of a nerd, and an open source geek, to miss such a brilliant opportunity.</p><p>So <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/n0nick/28002" target="_blank">here I go again</a>. Last week I submitted my proposal to contribute to the <a href="http://pygame.org/" target="_blank">Pygame</a> project.</p><p>Pygame is an open source Python library for building games. Yes, actual computer games. With graphics and stories and high scores and all. They&#8217;re doing pretty good, and I was actually just checking it out using the new <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/index.html" target="_blank">Making Games with Python</a> book when I noticed they&#8217;re participating in GSoC this year.</p><p><a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/n0nick/28002" target="_blank">My project proposal</a> is about re-designing and re-writing their Sprite and Scene systems, which are two very basic modules that handle graphics and game workflow.<br />These are very basic, fundamental modules, which mean a large part of the work would consist of consulting the Pygame community, thinking and designing.</p><p>Three reasons I&#8217;m hyped about this project:</p><ol><li>It&#8217;s game development! The reason I got into programming all along! Which is pretty awesome. And also, it&#8217;s a lot different than the programming I&#8217;m used to, and that&#8217;s cool too.</li><li>It&#8217;s about code design and best practices, which is a part of development I&#8217;ve grown to really like. This is a great opportunity to evolve in this field.</li><li>It&#8217;s about working with a large open source community, and using a lot of feedback. Which is always fun, and very educating.</li></ol><p>Two things I&#8217;m not so excited about:</p><ol><li>It falls on my finals period this year too. So, another month of juggling.</li><li>It might not happen at all! Right now my proposal is reviewed by Pygame and <a href="http://python.org/psf/" target="_blank">The Python Software Foundation</a> and accepted proposals will only be announced on April 23rd. Until then, all I have is suspense.</li></ol><p>Last year, I didn&#8217;t have any blog set up and I managed <a href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/User:N0nick/GSoC_Journal" target="_blank">my project journal</a> in the Apertium wiki.<br />So I was thinking, this year, if all goes well, I could use this here blog to tell you (and the Pygame guys) about the progress I&#8217;m making and about the many things I&#8217;m learning in the process. Could be nice.</p><p>So, here&#8217;s to that.</p>
